      <p id="tribute-info">Subhas Chandra Bose, byname Netaji (“Respected Leader”), (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack,
        Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary prominent in the
        independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against
        the
        Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other
        times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for
        socialist policies.</p>
